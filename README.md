## Introduction
 I was a research assistant at Mountain Lake Biological Station under the supervision of Dr. Vincent Formica. The goals for the summer were to assist Dr. Formica and his colleagues in the collection of Forked Fungus Beetle social network data and to develop and execute an independent beetle social network research project. 

## Background 
Forked Fungus Beetles (Bolitotherus cornutus) are social insects that spend the majority of their lives on a few species of fungi. It is on these fungal brackets that they socialize and develop social networks. In biology, social networks, are used to statistically measure the interactions of animals within their societies. Because social interactions depend strongly on the positions of the interacting individuals, understanding how movement affects those social interactions could give us a better understanding of where individuals fit within society. To measure position within social networks we typically use measures of centrality like strength and betweenness. Strength quantifies both the number of social partners an individual has and the amount of social interactions that occur between the animal and its partners. On the other hand, betweenness measures how central an animal is in connecting different parts of a social network together. 

## Methods 
<code>**Interested in studying how migration and movement affect beetle social networks, we developed a project that investigated how movement within beetle populations affects strength and betweenness.**</code> To measure movement within populations, we used the number of unique fungal brackets each beetle was observed on in the 2016 breeding season. We, then, used a general linear mixed model analysis to assess whether movement predicted betweenness and strength. Number of observations, elytra size, and sex were used as fixed effects and population was used as a random effect.  


 ## Findings 
We found that movement only predicted betweenness in male-only social networks in contrast to joint and female-only social networks. In our strength analysis, we found that beetle movement predicted strength in all three of our social network models. These results showed that although strength and betweenness are highly correlated, they vary across sex-specified networks. Our results also showed that as male beetles, in particular, are moving from fungal bracket to fungal bracket, they are meeting with new beetles and strengthening their interactions with other beetles while also connecting otherwise separate parts of their social networks together.
